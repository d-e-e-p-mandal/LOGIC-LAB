```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int a = 3, b= 5;

    printf("%d\n",++(a*b+1));

    return 0;
}
```

`Output : Error `

`Explanation :`
```diff
    ++(a*b+1)
    = ++(3*5+1)
    = ++(16)

16 is constant not variable so we can not perform pre-increment and post increment operation on constant. Pre-increment and post increment are perform on variable.
